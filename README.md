# Documentation

## How to:

- 

### My decision-making process in selecting the topic and incorporating AI-generated content.

- This semester for Emerging Production Techniques I designed an Audio-Visual hand tracking synth. I was inspired by this and wanted to make one using html, CSS and JavaScript. I researched different ways of doing this and landed on this framework called Tone.js. I then looked at some tutorials and documentation to get started. I would then prompt Copilot to find a solution to problems I had during the development of the webpage.

### AI tools used

- Copilot - to help with code and prompts
  I used Copilot for the majority of the development stage of this assignment. I found Copilot pretty useful because it was geared towards code based problems.
- ChatGPT - for prompts and information
  I only used ChatGPT a few times. For the technical coding problems I found the prompts were worse than Copilot.

### How did I leverage front-end concepts to achieve my design goals?

- I leveraged front-end concepts by being familiar with synthesisers work and are designed. I used sliders which are a fundamental part of synthesisers.

### Challenges I encountered and solutions devised during the development process.

- I encountered a problem in that I had no clue what I was doing when I first started working on this assignment. My knowledge of JavaScript is limited which made it hard to implement code that I liked. This is where Copilot came in handy. If I had an idea I would ask Copilot how to do it...Which would sometimes work. This was helpful because I would get a bit closer and I could analyse the code further.

### Lessons learned and improvements I would implement in future projects.

- I learnt that if I want to use AI then I shouldn’t get complacent. This happened during this assignment and the code became spaghetti and I couldn’t work out what was doing what. Next time I will research further and look into what the AI actually was trying to fix. I feel like some solutions the AI comes up with aren’t always the best.
- This is a barebones synthesiser which showcases what I wanted to accomplish. I would like to improve upon it though. I think it is a good start but eventually I would love to build a fully functioning synthesiser with a lot of different mechanisms and features added.
- I would also improve upon the design being a bit more skeuomorphic.

### FINAL THOUGHTS

- I don’t think I like AI. It takes away my control from being able to build code the way I like. If I use it I become complacent. I would much rather properly learn how to do something than rely on Artificial Intelligence.
