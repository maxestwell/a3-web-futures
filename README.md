# Assessment 3: Web futures

**Type**: Website and written component  
**Weighting**: 30%  
**Method**: Independent  
**Length**: website length variable and written content 500 words  
**Submission**: online

## Assessment description

This project allows you to experiment with new web technologies to create an experimental interactive interface.

This assessment will provide evidence towards the following unit learning outcomes:

1. Identify and critique a range of front-end web design concepts, skills and theories;
2. Experiment with the creation of web-based interactive interfaces using appropriate concepts and techniques; and
3. Review and evaluate appropriate development methodologies in the creation of interactive works.

## Assessment instructions

In this project, you will leverage your front-end web design skills to push the boundaries and create an experimental, responsive web-based interface.
We will kickstart the project using a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT) to provide a basic foundation for you to build upon.

The primary focus will be on showcasing your ability to experiment with new web technologies, understand front-end design concepts, and employ appropriate development methodologies.

The topic of the website is up to you, keep it simple though, the focus here is on the code and the design, not the content.

You should consider how you can implement all your interaction design skills, including user-centred design, accessibility considerations and ensuring that you right valid HTML5.

At the end, write a reflective piece that provides insights into your production process, understanding, and approach to the assessment item. Address the following:

- Your decision-making process in selecting the topic and incorporating AI-generated content.
- How you leveraged front-end concepts to achieve your design goals.
- Challenges encountered and solutions devised during the development process.
- Lessons learned and improvements you would implement in future projects.

## Submission

Submit a working link to the website, your code on GitHub and include the research and documentation as a markdown file in the submission.

## Assessment formatting guidelines

- File type: html, css, markdown
- Referencing style (including whether referencing is included in the word count, and whether references are assessed in the marking rubric): References are included in the word count. Text references are to be in APA; visual references are to include a link to the source.
- Cover sheet (if required): N/A
- Generative AI: use is permitted, but you need to show how you've learnt from any generated content
